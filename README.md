A good start: No bullshit daily journaling helper

**Welcome!** 
I created this app to support my daily journaling. 

‚ùì**How does it work?** 
1. You are offered a list of prompt sets. Each set has 2-5 questions.
2. Select the ones you feel like today and click "Start journaling".
3. Answer questions one by one.
4. In the end, you can simply send it to your email or download it as text, markdown, or enex file.

üí°**Tip** I usually use it on my phone, then send it as an email to my Evernote app. Most note apps have a personalized email address for you that you can use to email yourself notes.

‚ùó**The app doesn't save any data** so once you're done, it disappears.

The prompts are a selection of my favourite approaches: 
*Morning pages*: Helps you get out all the thoughts that are roaming around. It asks to reflect on how you feel about the day ahead and what you're looking forward to. This is a method created by Julie Cameron in her famous book on fostering creativity - [The Artist's Way](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/).
*Future self*: Supports incrimental change of behaviours and emptional patterns. This list is created by Dr. Nicole LePera aka [The Holistic Psychologist](https://holisticpsych.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets/Future_Self_Journal_2020.pdf).
*Morning Productivity*: Helps you set priorities for your day and identifying barriers to productivity.
*Gratitude*: Encourages you to reflect on what you're grateful for today. Research shows that gratitude when cultivated as a pratice or a trait enhances all aspects of [long-term well-being](https://escholarship.org/content/qt4zs2n2rw/qt4zs2n2rw_noSplash_9a4be7c0df0ba667a8d8eee09d0d016e.pdf#page=33.09), including perceived happiness, mental health and even physical health. 
*Manifestation*: Helps to set clear intentions for living the life you want to live. Manifestation has gotten a bed rep as being a bit whimsical, and rightly so - in most forms, it is a pseudoscience. But [research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/click-here-for-happiness/202009/what-is-manifestation-science-based-ways-to-manifest) has repeatedly shown that believing you can do something makes it more likely that you'll succeed. And the opposite - believing in bad things tends to lead to them happening more often.
